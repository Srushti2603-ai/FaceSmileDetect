# FaceSmileDetection
This Python script uses OpenCV to perform real-time face and smile detection from a webcam feed.

It utilizes Haar cascades to identify faces and smiles, drawing rectangles around detected areas. 

The program continuously processes video frames and allows users to exit by pressing 'q'.
